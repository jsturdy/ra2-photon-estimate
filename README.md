# ra2-photon-estimate
Scripts to run the RA2 ZInvisible photon estimate used for the 8 TeV analysis

A sample directory, complete with the necessary ROOT files can be found:
lxplus:~sturdy/work/public/RA2/ra2-photon-estimate

You can also see the log files and other outputs (pdf,png,eps,C,tex) in the same location.

I will attempt to recreate the instructions to run the various scripts to produce the output, as well as what needs to be run prior to this step.
